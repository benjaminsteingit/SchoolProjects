# School Projects

This is a collection of assignments and projects from various computer science courses.

This code is not intended to be copied or used for any purpose other than demonstrating my expereince with the Java programing language.

Most of the projects in this repo are based on prompts or guidance from an instructor.  Prompts are usually a basic outline or instructions for an assignment, such as the names of methods or classes and what they should do when called.  The mechanics and execution of those methods and classes are my creations.
